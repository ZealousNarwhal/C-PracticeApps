# C-PracticeApps
Some miscellaneous applications I made to practice my C#


RecursiveDelegates.cs:
This is a simple Console Program that was written to get some practice using both recursion and delegates. It is a simple console loop that asks the user to pick an option for a basic math operation. The user is then prompted for numerical inputs and is then given the correct output. The user chooses if they want to do another operation, and if not the program closes.
