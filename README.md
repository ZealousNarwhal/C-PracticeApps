# C-PracticeApps
Some miscellaneous applications I made to practice my C#


RecursiveDelegates.cs:
This is a simple Console Program that was written to get some practice using both recursion and delegates. It is a simple console loop that asks the user to pick an option for a basic math operation. The user is then prompted for numerical inputs and is then given the correct output. The user chooses if they want to do another operation, and if not the program closes.

Typing-Game:
This is a simple Console Program that was written to get some practice with reading information from files and parcing that information into useful data. The program reads data from one of two files provided (the other one was included for testing purposes, but is not actually currently used), and parces the data into a list of words. One of these words is then selected for the player to input. If they do so they damage the enemy, and if they fail to type it correctly they lose and the application ends.
